// Find a duplicate, Space Edition™.
// We have an array of integers, where:
//
// The integers are in the range 1..n
// The array has a length of n+1
// It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice.
// But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.
//
// Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array.
// (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)
//
// We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip Macbook Pro With Retina Display™.
// Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM.
// So we need to optimize for space!
