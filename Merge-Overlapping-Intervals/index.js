// Merge Overlapping Intervals
// Description
// Given an array (list) of intervals as input where each interval has a start and end timestamps.
// Input array is sorted by starting timestamps.
// You are required to merge overlapping intervals and return output array (list).

// Consider below input array.
// Intervals (1, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (6, 8) are overlapping so should be merged to one big interval (1, 8). 
// Similarly intervals (10, 12) and (11, 15) are also overlapping intervals and should be merged to (10, 15).
